## Useful sensor libraries

Purpose of these libraries is to make it easy to sample data and report without blocking the main loop. If you want to connect more than one sensor it should be possible to create multiple instances of each sensor library.

[Most of my libraries are also accessible at PlatforIO.org](http://platformio.org/lib/search?query=author%253A%2522Sorenso%2522).
